# Cat and Dog Classification

The Dogs & Cats is a foundational problem for a basic CNN(convolutional neural network) model which involves classifying images as a dog or a cat. 

The dataset can be used for learning how to develop,evaluate and use convolutional deep learning neural networks for classification of images. 

This includes how to develop a robust test harness for estimating the performance of the model, exploring improvements for the model by changing the paramters of the model, saving and loading the model to make predicitions on new data.


# Introduction ðŸ’¥

In this article, we will discover how to develop a CNN to classify images of dogs and cats.

# Deep Learning Model

# Architecture

The architecture of the Cat vs Dog Image Classification model consists of the following Layers and components:

# Layers :

The input layer consist of a Conv2D with 32 filters and activation relu.

The model contain the 3 blocks of convolution with increasing filters and activation relu.

Each convolution block contains Batch Noramlization, Max pooling (pool_size = 2) and Dropout (0.2).

The fully connected layers contain Flatten layer, Dense layer with 512 units and a Dropout layer.

The output layer is a Dense layer with 2 units and softmax activation.

# Components:

Input Layer: Receives input images for classification.

Convolutional Layers: Extract features from the images through convolutional operations.

Pooling Layers: Reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.

Flatten Layer: Convert the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.

Fully Connected Layers: Perform classification using densely connected layers.

Output Layer: Provides the final prediction probabilities for cat and dog classes.

# Compile the model

Finally we will compile the model .There are 3 things to mention here : Optimizer,Loss, Metrics

Optimizer :- 
To minimize cost function we use different methods For ex :- like gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent. So these are call optimizers. We are using a default one here which is adam.â€‹

Loss :- 
To make our model better we either minimize loss or maximize accuracy. Neural Networks always minimize loss. To measure it we can use different formulas like 'categorical_crossentropy' or 'binary_crossentropy'. Here I have used binary_crossentropy.â€‹

Metrics :- 
This is to denote the measure of your model. Can be accuracy or some other metric.

# Conclusion
We successfully built a deep neural network model by implementing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify dog and cat images with Accuracy of 87%.

The model was used to predict the classes of the images from the independent test set and results were submitted to test the accuracy of the prediction with fresh data.

The Cat vs Dog Image Classification model demonstrates the successful implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification tasks. 

By accurately distinguishing between images of cats and dogs, this project showcases the potential of deep learning algorithms in solving real-world problems involving image analysis. 

Through this project, we aim to inspire further exploration of CNNs and their applications in various domains,
